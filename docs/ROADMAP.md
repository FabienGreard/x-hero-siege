# Slice-first roadmap

This roadmap is a scope guard, not a content backlog. Work stops for player review after the first complete 5–10 minute run.

## `0.1.4` — Wraith Host summon fantasy

**Status:** implemented and locally verified on 2026-07-10; deployment verification pending a configured game host.

- Replace the five-projectile placeholder with persistent, authoritative wraith minions.
- Give summoned spirits independent acquisition, pursuit, repeated strikes, retargeting, idle orbiting, expiry, and Rift Heart interaction.
- Render a distinct Gravebinder-aligned spirit silhouette without obscuring enemies or the Nexus.
- Preserve the hero's established controls, cooldown, rank progression, sustain identity, and multiplayer authority boundary.
- Validate server ownership, real rendered motion, horde readability, multiplayer snapshots, and production build.

## `0.1.3` — action-bar skill progression

**Status:** implemented, verified, and stopped for player review on 2026-07-10.

- Remove the separate skill-choice panel and make the established `Q`/`E`/`R`/`F` bar the only upgrade surface.
- Show a compact gold `+` only on legal upgrades; keep the rest of each slot dedicated to casting.
- Keep `Q`/`E`/`R`/`F` as cast inputs and add `Ctrl` + ability key as the matching keyboard upgrade shortcut.
- Cap banked points against remaining ranks so fully maxed builds never receive an unusable point or prompt.
- Verify direct mouse upgrade, keyboard upgrade, and normal casting at 1440×900; stop here for review.

**Resolved in `0.1.4`:** Gravebinder's Wraith Host now uses authoritative summon/minion behavior.

## `0.1.2` — player-count-native siege space

**Status:** implemented, verified, and stopped for player review on 2026-07-09.

- Freeze one active defense lane per starting player from wave one through the breach.
- Scale total pressure through lane count while keeping per-lane spawn cadence and enemy health consistent with solo.
- Deepen the city, gates, approaches, and counterattack road without changing the approved camera language or central Nexus.
- Visibly seal inactive approaches and remove persistent monster direction markers while preserving attack windups.
- Verified solo and four-player topology at 1440×900 with keyboard and mouse; stopped here for review.

**Recorded at this checkpoint:** Gravebinder's Wraith Host did not yet deliver its promised summon fantasy, and a fully maxed hero could receive an unusable skill point. The point-cap issue is resolved in `0.1.3`; Gravebinder remains deferred.

## `0.1.1` — readable combat grammar

**Status:** implemented, verified, and stopped for player review on 2026-07-09.

- Keep the approved camera, Citadel, Nexus pressure, density, and phase flow.
- Reduce the action language to LMB primary plus four large `Q`/`E`/`R`/`F` ability slots; remove Space dodge.
- Replace the generic run talent with one skill point per hero level and visible per-ability ranks.
- Add authoritative hero windup/impact/recovery and enemy windup-before-damage states.
- Give Warden charge, wave, standard, and ultimate distinct world silhouettes.
- Verified before/after at 1440×900 with keyboard and mouse; stopped here for review.

## `0.1.0` — first playable vertical slice

**Status:** playable, verified, and stopped for player review on 2026-07-09.

### Foundation

- Browser-first client with an elevated three-quarter camera and compact HUD.
- Authoritative Bun multiplayer room for 1–4 local browser clients.
- Central Aegis Citadel, visible Heartfire Nexus, and four readable gates.
- Server-enforced selection of exactly four unique heroes with no duplicates.

### Playable proof

- All four heroes selectable and recognizably different under one shared control layout.
- Fast movement, aimed primary attacks, dodge, three abilities, and an ultimate.
- Dense but readable demon combat with hit flashes, knockback, impact audio, restrained shake, and clear telegraphs.
- A short defense sequence that escalates into one forced gate-breach pressure state.
- One non-pausing, three-way talent choice with an immediately readable build effect.
- A short group counterattack and one Rift payoff encounter.
- Nexus destruction defeat state and Rift destruction victory state.

### Verification gate

- Type and automated tests pass.
- One-, two-, and four-client rooms share authoritative state.
- Simultaneous duplicate hero selection cannot succeed.
- A complete run is playable from hero selection to victory or defeat in 5–10 minutes.
- Camera, performance, effects, HUD, and threat readability receive a manual browser playtest.
- `/health` and `/debug/state` expose enough information to diagnose a run without changing gameplay.

## Stop and review

The implementation is currently at this gate. Do not begin deferred work until the playable build has been reviewed.

After the `0.1.0` proof is playable, collect feedback on only these questions:

1. Does movement and attacking feel immediately satisfying?
2. Is the central Nexus objective always clear?
3. Do the four heroes feel meaningfully different?
4. Does the breach create exciting pressure rather than confusion?
5. Does the counterattack and Rift destruction feel like a payoff?
6. Is the camera close enough for impact and wide enough for co-op awareness?

Do not schedule expansion until those answers are reviewed against the actual build.

## Deferred beyond the slice

- Larger wave and boss catalogs.
- Equipment sockets, loot rarity, recipes, and item evolutions.
- Permanent Citadel Renown and corruption difficulties.
- Matchmaking, public rooms, reconnection, and join-in-progress polish.
- Mobile and controller input implementations.
- Additional maps, modes, heroes, or long-form campaign content.

The hero roster remains capped at four even after expansion.
